# Data Cleaning - Skincare E-commerce Dataset

This project focuses on cleaning a fictional skincare e-commerce dataset using Python. The dataset simulates real-world issues such as inconsistent formatting, missing values, and invalid data entries. The goal was to prepare the data for reliable use in analysis.

##  Project Objective

- Perform full data cleaning on a CSV file representing sales transactions from an online skincare store.
- Identify and correct inconsistencies in brand names, product names, and categories.
- Handle missing and invalid values, including negative prices and malformed dates.
- Export a clean version of the dataset to Excel for future use in dashboards or reports.

##  Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- Excel (for final export)
